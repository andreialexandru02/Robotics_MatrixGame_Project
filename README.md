# Robotics_MatrixGame_Project

The requirments of this project were to create a simple game on an 8x8 matrix, along with an interactive menu on an LCD screen.
</br>
In the menu the player should be able to start the game, go to settings or see information about to play the game. In the settings he or she can set LCD brightness and Matrix Brightness, see details about the game's creator, set the difficulty, see and reset highscores and also toggle sounds.
</br> 
I chose Crossy Roads, because it is game that i used to play as a child and can also be very well implemented on an 8x8 matrix. The player starts at thme button of the matrix and controlls a blinking dot. While crossing the road you'll have to dodge cars driving at full speed and cross rivers on a fast moving platform. There are 3 lives that he or she can lose before losing the game
</br>
For this project i used an LCD Screen, a led Matrix, a buzzer, a potentiometer, a MAX7219 Driver and all necesarry wires.
