# Crossy Roads Matrix Game

The requirments of this project were to create a simple game on an 8x8 matrix, along with an interactive menu on an LCD screen.
</br>
</br>
I chose **Crossy Roads**, because it is a game that everybody used to play as a child. It had customizable characters and environment that added a lot of fun to it. 
</br>
</br>
The player starts at the button of the matrix and controlls a blinking dot. While crossing the road you'll have to dodge cars driving at full speed and cross rivers on a fast moving platform. There are 3 lives that he or she can lose before losing the game. The goal is to get safely across the street in the shortest time possible.
